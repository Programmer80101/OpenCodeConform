# OpenCodeConform
OpenCodeConform is an open-source project dedicated to collecting and organizing the best practices, standards, and style guides in software development. Our goal is to provide developers with a unified platform where they can find up-to-date recommendations and examples for writing high-quality, maintainable, and secure code.
