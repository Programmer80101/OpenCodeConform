As contributors and maintainers of the OpenCodeConform project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Participants

Participants are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Participants who engage in behavior that violates our Code of Conduct may be temporarily or permanently excluded from the project community.

## Reporting Violations

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us by contacting us via email at [valentin.karnaukhovv@gmail.com](mailto:valentin.karnaukhovv@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
